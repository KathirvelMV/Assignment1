## Assignment 1 for CS 648 from Kathirvel Manivannan Vimaladevi, RedID - 131140409

_A quick detour about one of my memories before I describe the website_

> "_While I was working on this assignment, it took me back to my middle school where I created my first static HTML website for my beloved cartoons like Tom & Jerry, Doraemon, etc.  
Those were good times!!_"

### About this Website

[Free Website Background Image taken from here][Background]

[Background]: https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-clouds-on-blue-sky-19670/

I have used a few HTML features in this page and they are as follows:

* Headers like h1,h3,h4 depending on the importance of the subheading
* Italic and Underline formatting
* Paragraph tag for normal text placement
* Unordered list and Blockquote for Client Testimonials

It was a basic website as mentioned in the Assignment document by using the asset file with information and I have tried to make it in a simple and presentable fashion.   

After completely going through the [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) tutorial,  
I have also incorporated some of the MD features on this file. Hope it suffices the requirements.

**Thank you professor!**
